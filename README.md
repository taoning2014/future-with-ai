This is a HackDay project where I used **Next.js** and **Vercel** to build a personal website to share my thoughts on how we can better leverage AI technologies in the future.  
You can visit the site at [futurewithAI.xyz](http://futurewithAI.xyz).

The website includes several responsive pages and interactive features such as a newsletter subscription and a discussion forum.
